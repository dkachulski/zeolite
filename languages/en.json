        "information-text-long": "The active and natural mineral additive Trass is used by 30 to 40% in the production of pozzolanic cement for the hydrolic engineering (dam walls, bridges, tunnels, etc.), as it is moisture resistent. It is also used in the production of the mass brands of cement as it increases their density and makes them restistent to wear from environmentl factors.",

        "product-1-text": "Our product has a fraction of 0-50mm. (grain size less than 80 mm.) and with a moisture content of 8%. During the summer months, as a results of the Sun's rays, 60 to 70% of the processed active natural mineral supplement Trass has a fraction of 0 to 50mm., and the rest is  +5mm. The activity, through the absorbtion of СаО is at least 150mg/g after the 30th day. The chemical composition of natural zeolite, extracted in the quarry is formed by oligocene tuffs. As part of the natural zeolites, Trass is composed mainly of 56 to 65% of clinoptilolite with kuartz, feldspar, mica, glauconite, volcanic glass and clay minerals as admixture. Under a microscope, the Trass has grey-white to cream, white-pink, light redish to light green color with a colorful hue, determined by rock rubble and dark-green gaps of volcanic glass.",
        "product-2-text": "The maximum capacity is 1200 tons per one 8-hour shift, which is 375000 tons per working year (8 months during the spring-summer period). Extraction of trass is not recommended during the winter period due to the higher moisture content. This is why we can store up to 50000 tons of the product and ship it during the 4 non-extraction months. We have rubber conveyor belts that transport the crused material to bunkers, where the finished product is stored for the winter period and loaded on railway wagons, ready for delivery to our customers.",
        "product-3-text": "We offer land (train/truk) and see transport in indivudually packaged big bags or in bulk in containers. The quarry has its own industrial railway track and an organic connection with the railway station Zhelezni Vrata, Karzhali. The closest sea ports to us are Port Burgas, Port Varna (Bulgaria) and Port Thessaloniki (Greece). Depending on your location, our team will offer you the best delivery option. ",

        "faq-question-2": "What type of Zeolite do we offer?",
        "faq-question-3": "Where is it used?",
        "faq-question-4": "What else can you use Trass for?",
        "faq-question-5": "What is the cost and delivery?",
        "faq-answer-1": "It is an aluminosilicate mineral that is microporous and used as catalysts and absorbants. There are over 150 synthetic and over 40 types of natural zeolites. Pozzonal (Trass) that we offer is one the natural zeolite minerals.",
        "faq-answer-2": "We offer the natural active mineral additive Trass, which is a natural Zeolite with 56 to 65% clinoptilolite content. Its use as an additive in various brands of cements and concretes accelerates hardening, increases strength properties, inproves resistence is harsh environments and reduces moisture permeability.",
        "faq-answer-3": "Our Trass is with high purity and is used directly without need for further enrichment in varius brands of cement. It is most applicable in pozzolanic cement in the construction of tunnels, bridges, dams, sewers and more.",
        "faq-answer-4": "Apart from its uses in the construction industry: 1. Trass has highly selective cation exchange capacity, which makes it extremely useful in controlling specific cationic water levels in agriculture. 2. It has a selective cationic separation used to eliminate heavy metals from waste water and radioactive substances. 3. Allows for complete separation of radioactive substances and other toxic mixtures in the soil. 4. It is also used as an additive to animal fodder to absorbe toxins.",
